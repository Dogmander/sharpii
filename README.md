# Sharpii - A command line libWiiSharp tool

Sharpii is a command line app for windows that I (person66) made, which uses leathl's libWiiSharp.dll (as of version 1.2 it acutally uses scooby74029's mod of libWiiSharp) to perform tasks such as:
- Pack, unpack, or edit .wad files
- Pack, and unpack U8 archives
- Patch IOS .wad files with various patches
- Download files from NUS
- Convert a .wav file to .bns, and vice versa
- Convert an image file to a .tpl, and vice versa
- Send a .dol or .wad to the Homebrew Channel over Wi-Fi
